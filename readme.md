# AI Image & Video Colorizer / B&W Converter

This project provides a web application to automatically colorize black and white images and videos, or convert color media to black and white, using a deep learning model.



## Features

*   **Image Colorization:** Upload a black and white image to get a colorized version.
*   **Video Colorization:** Upload a black and white video to get a colorized version (processed frame by frame).
*   **B&W Conversion:** Convert color images or videos to black and white.
*   **Web Interface:** User-friendly web UI with drag-and-drop file support.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between dark and light themes for comfortable viewing.
*   **OpenCV DNN Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained Caffe model for colorization.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:
    ```txt
    Flask==2.3.3 
    Werkzeug==2.3.7 
    numpy==1.24.4
    opencv-python==4.8.0.76
    # Add other specific versions if you know them
    # Or use 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' after installing manually
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: It's good practice to pin dependency versions. You can generate this file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after manually installing the packages below if you prefer.)*

    Alternatively, install packages manually:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask numpy opencv-python
    ```

4.  **Download Model Files:**
    The colorization model consists of three files:
    *   `colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt`
    *   `colorization_release_v2.caffemodel`
    *   `pts_in_hull.npy`

    Place these files into the `models/` directory. You can typically find these files from the original source of the colorization model (e.g., [Zhang et al., 2016 - Colorful Image Colorization](https://richzhang.github.io/colorization/)).
    *   **Direct Links (if available and permitted by license):**
        *   Prototxt: [Link to prototxt file]
        *   Caffemodel: [Link to caffemodel file]
        *   pts_in_hull.npy: [Link to npy file]
    *(Important: Verify the source and license of these model files. If you cannot provide direct links, guide users on how to obtain them, e.g., "Download from the official project page linked in References.")*

    **Ensure the `models/` directory exists and contains these files before running the application.**

## Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the project's root directory (e.g., `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`).
2.  Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

    If you started the app with `host='0.0.0.0'`, you can also access it from other devices on your local network using your machine's IP address (e.g., `http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:5000/`).

## Usage

1.  **Upload File:** Drag and drop an image or video file onto the designated area, or click "browse" to select a file.
    *   Supported image formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
    *   Supported video formats: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv` (output will always be `.mp4`)
2.  **Choose Action:**
    *   Click "ðŸŽ¨ Colorize" to colorize the uploaded media.
    *   Click "âš« Convert to B&W" to convert the media to black and white.
3.  **Processing:** A status message and progress bar will indicate that processing is underway. This can take some time, especially for videos.
4.  **View Output:** The processed image or video will be displayed on the page.
5.  **Theme Toggle:** Click the sun/moon icon in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark modes.

## Technical Details

*   **Backend:** Flask (Python)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
*   **Colorization Model:** Caffe deep learning model via OpenCV's DNN module.
    *   Based on the work by Zhang et al. (2016).
*   **Image/Video Processing:** OpenCV

## Troubleshooting

*   **Model Files Not Found:** Ensure the `models/` directory exists and contains `colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt`, `colorization_release_v2.caffemodel`, and `pts_in_hull.npy`.
*   **Video Not Playing:**
    *   Try clearing your browser cache for the site.
    *   Check the browser's developer console (usually F12) for errors related to media playback or network requests.
    *   The output video format is MP4 (`mp4v` codec). Ensure your browser supports this.
*   **Large File Uploads:** The application has a default upload limit (currently 200MB). For larger files, you might need to adjust `app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH']` in `app.py` and potentially configure your web server (if deploying to production) to handle larger request bodies.
*   **"Address already in use" Error:** Port 5000 is already being used by another application. You can either stop the other application or change the port in `app.py` (e.g., `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, debug=True)`).

## Future Enhancements

*   Real-time processing progress updates from backend to frontend (e.g., using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events).
*   Option to adjust processing parameters.
*   Support for more file formats.
*   More advanced UI/UX for error handling and feedback.
*   Batch processing.
*   User accounts and history.
*   Deployment instructions for production environments (e.g., using Gunicorn, Nginx, Docker).
