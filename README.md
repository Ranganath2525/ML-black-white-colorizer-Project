## ⚙️ Features  
- Converts grayscale (black & white) images to color.  
- Uses a deep learning model for realistic colorization.  
- Simple frontend interface to upload and view results.  
- Extendable to videos for full colorization.

## 🚀 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ranganath2525/ML-black-white-colorizer-Project.git
   cd ML-black-white-colorizer-Project

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
🖼️ Usage

Upload a black & white image through the frontend.

The ML model processes the image.

Download or view the colorized output.

🔮 Future Improvements

Support for real-time video colorization.

Use of GANs or Transformers for better accuracy.

Cloud-based deployment (e.g., Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces).
